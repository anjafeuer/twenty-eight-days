= 28 Days

== Usage

It is important to distinguish the *web app* from the *cycle data*.

The web app is publicly available (i.e. you don't have to deploy your own copy):

https://twenty-eight-days.github.io/twenty-eight-days

It can either be used in *demo mode*, where you can explore all features in action with mock data.

Alternatively, you can use it to actually track your own personal data.
This requires a *personal userbase account* to manage your encrypted cycle data.

=== Demo Mode

Appending the `demo` string showcases the app with mock data:

----
https://twenty-eight-days.github.io/twenty-eight-days?demo
----

=== Personal Userbase Account

[WARNING]
====
The app is still in early alpha stage!
On-boarding is very raw and only recommended for developers.
While your data is always encrypted and will not leak, you might experience loss or corruption.
====

Your personal cycle data is hosted through userbase, a service providing encrypted databases.
The starter plan is *free* and offers 1 app with 100 users, which is enough for our purpose.

First, you need to https://v1.userbase.com/#create-admin[create an admin account].

Userbase will create a https://v1.userbase.com/#app=Starter%20App[Starter App] for you.
Copy the *App Id* to somewhere safe, it is needed to identify your database.

Now that you have an `App Id`, you can add a new database user via the (very experimental!) sign-up form:

* Open the form: https://twenty-eight-days.github.io/twenty-eight-days?signUp
* Fill in credentials (password min 6 characters)
* _In case of errors, check dev console for details_

If the sign-up process is *successful*, your new user will already be signed in – you are all set and can start tracking your cycle data! ✨

[TIP]
====
* You won't need the sign-up form again, so just use the https://twenty-eight-days.github.io/twenty-eight-days[plain URL] from now on
* Users can be deleted via the userbase admin panel
====

== Development

=== CRA

This app is based on https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app[create-react-app], so the usual tooling is available:

First time dependency installation:
----
yarn install
----

Auto-refreshing dev mode:
----
yarn start
----

=== .env.local

Storing your credentials *locally* makes the log-in process less tedious:

[title=.env.local]
----
REACT_APP_USERBASE_APP_ID=1234-abcd-1234-abcd-xyz
REACT_APP_USERBASE_USERNAME=test
REACT_APP_USERBASE_PASSWORD=testtest
----

=== Deployment To GitHub Pages

* Update version in `package.json`
* `git tag v1.2.3`
* `yarn deploy` (be aware of `.env.local`)
* `git push`
* `git push --tags`
